deprecations:
  - The variable ``maas_filesystem_overrides`` has been deprecated.
    This option is now simply ``maas_filesystem_monitors``. If the
    deployer wants to override the file system monitors they can
    now do so using the default variable ``maas_filesystem_monitors``.
    The variable ``maas_filesystem_overrides`` will be removed in Q.
